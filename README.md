# Telco Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI)

## About the Project
Customer churn is a common problem in the telecom industry. In this project, I worked on a telecom customer dataset to understand customer behavior and identify the main reasons why customers are leaving.

I created an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps analyze churn based on contract type, tenure, internet service, payment method, and other customer details.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Find the overall churn rate
- Identify customer groups with high churn
- Understand which services and contracts lead to more churn
- Create a clean and interactive dashboard for analysis

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX
- CSV dataset
- Data modeling and visualization

---

## Dashboard Features
- KPI cards showing:
  - Total customers
  - Churned customers
  - Churn rate
  - Retained customers
- Churn analysis by:
  - Contract type
  - Internet service
  - Payment method
  - Customer tenure
- Interactive slicers for filtering data
- Table view for detailed customer-level insights

## Key Observations
- Customers with month-to-month contracts have the highest churn
- Customers with lower tenure are more likely to churn
- Fiber optic internet users show higher churn compared to DSL
- Customers using electronic check as payment method churn more frequently

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before building the dashboard, the data was cleaned by:
- Fixing inconsistent category values
- Handling missing values
- Creating calculated columns and measures using DAX
- Ensuring correct data types for analysis
